1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
I'm here today to talk about thinking

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.239
for yourself. And I must admit, I did

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.920
use AI to help me think about it.

4
00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:08.639
[laughter]

5
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.880
The the irony is not lost on me. But the

6
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.719
way I did so is not by using AI as an

7
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.519
assistant to help me prepare this talk

8
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.000
faster. Rather, I use AI as a tool for

9
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.760
thought. And by the end of this talk, I

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
would have explained what I mean by

11
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.359
that, why it's important, and given you

12
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.199
a glimpse of how it might work. But

13
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.880
first, I need to set the scene. Let's

14
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.119
look at a day in the life of a 21st

15
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.960
century knowledge worker. I arrive at my

16
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.480
office and look at my inbox full of

17
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280
emails.

18
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's summarize it. Okay, I'm struggling

19
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.559
to figure out how to respond here. So,

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.040
let's get AI to write a response. Next,

21
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.280
I need to write a report, but I'm struck

22
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.960
by the blank page problem. I know I'll

23
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.520
drop in some resources and get an AI

24
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.039
draft. Looks good to me. By the way,

25
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.879
writer's block used to be staring at a

26
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.399
blank page. Now, it's staring at a page

27
00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.800
that AI filled out for me and wondering

28
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.399
if I agree with it. I've become a

29
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.640
professional validator of a robot's

30
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.960
opinions.

31
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.799
I've got some data to analyze. Maybe AI

32
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.640
can analyze this data for me. Probably

33
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
correct. Okay, I've got to make a deck

34
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.479
as well. You know the drill. All right.

35
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.119
Oh, I was supposed to prototype

36
00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.119
something as well. Uh, okay. Let me vibe

37
00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.960
code something. All right. All this

38
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.240
looks good. Let's go. This isn't a

39
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.840
vision of the future. This is a

40
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.280
completely plausible, if slightly

41
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.119
exaggerated, picture of the world of

42
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.520
knowledge work today. Welcome to the age

43
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.360
of outsourced reason where the knowledge

44
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.880
worker no longer engages with the

45
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.799
materials of their craft. We've become

46
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.640
intellectual tourists. In our own work,

47
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.439
we visit ideas. We don't inhabit them.

48
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.920
Our relationship to our work is entirely

49
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.680
intermediated by AI. Some might say

50
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.680
alienated. We've heard that story

51
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.119
before. What's wrong with this picture?

52
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.280
For one thing, it's only one step

53
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.119
removed from this, which is important,

54
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
but that's a different talk. What I want

55
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.360
to focus on today is that using AI in

56
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
this way can have profound implications

57
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.119
on human thought. Consider creativity.

58
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.600
On an individual level, we might think

59
00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.320
that AI is a creativity boost, giving us

60
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.159
rapid access to new ideas. But numerous

61
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.479
studies have shown that on a collective

62
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.039
level, knowledge workers using AI

63
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.360
assistants produce a smaller range of

64
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.080
ideas than a group working manually.

65
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.599
We've created a hive mind, except the

66
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.520
hive is really boring and keeps

67
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.440
suggesting the same five ideas. Consider

68
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
critical thinking. We surveyed knowledge

69
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.599
workers about their use of AI. They

70
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.721
reported that they put less effort into

71
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.760
critical thinking when working with AI

72
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.160
[clears throat] than when working

73
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.080
manually. And this effect was greater

74
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.160
when they had greater confidence in AI

75
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.720
and less confidence in themselves.

76
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.040
Consider memory. When people rely on AI

77
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.560
to write for them, they remember less of

78
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.480
what they wrote. And when they read AI

79
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.080
generated summaries, it's hardly

80
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.920
surprising that they remember less than

81
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.599
if they'd read the document. And

82
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.200
finally, consider metacognition, which

83
00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.040
is the ability to think about your own

84
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.720
thinking process. Working with AI

85
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.800
requires significant metacognitive

86
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.959
reasoning about your task goals,

87
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.360
decomposing the task, the applicability

88
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.680
of genai, your ability to evaluate the

89
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.120
output. These are things which are built

90
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.640
into the process of working directly

91
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.159
with the material and which become

92
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.680
problematic when that material

93
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.120
engagement becomes intermediated.

94
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.800
Basically, we've become middle managers

95
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.640
for our own thoughts. So, what's the

96
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.080
score? We have fewer ideas. We think

97
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.000
about them less critically. We remember

98
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.680
them less well. and we have a harder

99
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.159
time doing it. Taken together, we can

100
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.239
see that AI assisted workflows can have

101
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.480
profound effects on human thinking. And

102
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.400
this extends even to seemingly trivial,

103
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.920
mundane tasks because these everyday

104
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.360
opportunities for exercising our

105
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.280
creativity, our critical thinking, and

106
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.440
our memory are essential for protecting

107
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.200
our cognitive musculature and allow us

108
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.879
to rise to the occasion when an

109
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.239
exceptionally complex task comes our

110
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.720
way. Studies show that when we don't use

111
00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.400
our brains, they get worse at brain

112
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.760
things. Nobel Prize Committee, please

113
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.159
hold your applause.

114
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.680
Is this the cost of progress?

115
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.480
We've solved the problem of having to

116
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.519
think. Unfortunately, thinking wasn't

117
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.439
actually a problem. It's like it's like

118
00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.959
we invented a cure for exercise and then

119
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.000
wondered why we're out of breath all the

120
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.159
time. You know, doesn't have to be this

121
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.400
way.

122
00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.319
Beyond AI as an assistant, I believe

123
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.319
that AI should be a tool for thought. AI

124
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.599
should challenge, not obey. And I

125
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.959
believe that right at this moment we are

126
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.799
at a critical juncture where the world

127
00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.120
of work is poised to be transformed by

128
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.479
generative AI. And we must act now to

129
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.880
shape and drive that transformation

130
00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.199
towards humanistic values. Of these two

131
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.880
diverging roads, we must take the one

132
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.600
less traveled. Beyond getting the job

133
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.080
done, a tool for thought helps us better

134
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.840
understand the job. Beyond getting it

135
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680
done faster, it helps us get it done

136
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.520
better. Beyond getting us to the right

137
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.520
answers, a tool for thought helps us ask

138
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.080
the right questions. Beyond automating

139
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.000
known processes, it helps us explore the

140
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.000
unknown. What does this look like? What

141
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.080
I'm about to show you is a prototype

142
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.840
developed by my colleagues and me at the

143
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.919
tools for thought team at Microsoft

144
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.440
Research in Cambridge. Now, please bear

145
00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.840
in mind that this is a live research

146
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.360
prototype. It's not a product and it's

147
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.360
just one of a series of explorations

148
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.960
that our team is conducting to study how

149
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.440
different modes of working with AI can

150
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.720
enhance human thought. So, let's look at

151
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.720
a fictitious example. Clara and her

152
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.120
colleagues run a company that sells

153
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.759
bottled beverages. They've just had a

154
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.520
meeting to discuss a new industry report

155
00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.520
that seems to have some pretty important

156
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.440
findings about consumer preferences for

157
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.280
sustainable packaging. Clara's

158
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.199
colleagues have asked her to write a

159
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.199
proposal arguing for how the company

160
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.440
ought to respond. So, she really needs

161
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.960
to get to grips with this proposal. She

162
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.520
really needs to get to grips with this

163
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.960
report, understand its findings and its

164
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.280
data and how it fits into her business

165
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.120
context. She starts by loading some

166
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.960
documents into her workspace. There's

167
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.880
the meeting transcript to remind her

168
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.960
what was discussed. Uh there's a recent

169
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.800
internal report from her own business.

170
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.639
Uh and of course there's the industry

171
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.160
report which she opens. She sees an

172
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.320
overview of the document along with

173
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160
section bysection summaries. Except

174
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.240
these aren't really just summaries. We

175
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.160
think of them more as lenses. They're

176
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.240
customizable micro representations of

177
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.320
the text that can emphasize what is most

178
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.840
relevant to the task at hand. So in this

179
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.360
case, Claraara selects the consumer's

180
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.960
lens.

181
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.880
She can select a section for deeper

182
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.600
reading. In this case, the first one. As

183
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.600
she reads, she makes notes about her

184
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.000
thoughts and highlights excerpts from

185
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.960
the document.

186
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.199
As she reads, she also sees AI generated

187
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.039
commentary and critiques. We call these

188
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.880
provocations. Here's a provocation that

189
00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.639
raises a potential opportunity which she

190
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.880
highlights and annotates. Note how this

191
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.880
process is a hybrid of completely manual

192
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.360
reading and completely relying on AI to

193
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.479
read for you. Clara still reads, but

194
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.000
intentionally and strategically.

195
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.479
Now, as Claraara is working, she's

196
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.800
building up an outline of her argument

197
00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.880
manually in this pane on the right. This

198
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.800
outline is lightly structured and allows

199
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.199
her to sketch out the flow of her

200
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.720
argument at a high level while still

201
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.960
retaining deep connections and being

202
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.400
grounded in the source documents. As a

203
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.960
result of which, we can already generate

204
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.560
a draft of the proposal. And Clara can

205
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.039
do things here like add a heading to the

206
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.560
outline to generate a paragraph. But

207
00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.880
what I want to draw your attention to

208
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.720
here is that while this text is AI

209
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.319
generated, Clara has a completely

210
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.080
different relationship to this text than

211
00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.400
if she just dropped in some documents

212
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.479
and said, "Write me a report." Because

213
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.080
this text is deeply rooted in a

214
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.000
cognitively effortful but

215
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.479
interactionally effortless thought

216
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.400
process. It reflects Clara's decisions,

217
00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:24.400
Clara's judgments, Clara's unique

218
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.080
personal professional expertise.

219
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.840
She sees another provocation, this time

220
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.120
in the outline. In this case, she

221
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.240
decides that while the provocation is

222
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.919
useful, she does not need to address it.

223
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.039
Unlike typical AI suggestions,

224
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.199
provocations are not meant to be

225
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.639
applicable all the time. They're instead

226
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.639
meant to stimulate your thinking about

227
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.639
your work. Because if you understand

228
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.560
your work well enough, deeply enough to

229
00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:46.400
make the confident to make the confident

230
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.240
decision not to accept a piece of

231
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.319
feedback, then the feedback process is

232
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.560
still working as intended. But we're not

233
00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:54.080
done yet. Clara has entirely new ways of

234
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.919
interacting with this text because of

235
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.599
generative AI. A really simple example

236
00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.360
is that she can just resize a paragraph

237
00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:00.960
to change its length. She can also

238
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.960
rapidly test different versions of this

239
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.800
text. For instance, in this paragraph,

240
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.840
she's wondering whether it would be more

241
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.000
effective if it took a more

242
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.199
inspirational or more practical tone.

243
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.440
So, she selects one of these

244
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:14.400
customizable dimensions and previews a

245
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.879
few alternatives and selects one. And at

246
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.120
select strategic points, indeed, she

247
00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:21.120
writes. As she writes, she sees

248
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.599
provocations that rather than

249
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.000
autocompleting her ideas, they raise

250
00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:27.680
alternatives. They identify fallacies.

251
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.080
They offer counter-arguments to help her

252
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.120
strengthen and develop her own argument.

253
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.959
There's something you won't find

254
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.200
anywhere in this interface, and that's a

255
00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:37.200
chat box. Clara's not having to chat

256
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.279
with anything to do her work. Yet, she

257
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.159
is silently and appropriately assisted

258
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:45.360
by her computer as a computer and not as

259
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:47.839
an ursat human. To put it simply, we

260
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.240
have gone from this

261
00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:52.240
to this. Throughout this process,

262
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.720
Claraara has been assisted and yes,

263
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.240
probably worked faster because of AI.

264
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.399
But she's also maintained direct

265
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.920
material engagement at strategic points.

266
00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:01.760
She read the relevant portions of the

267
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.920
document herself. She constructed her

268
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.519
decisions and her argument herself and

269
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.760
ultimately it can be said she has

270
00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:10.240
written this document herself. Moreover,

271
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.920
she worked better because of AI. AI

272
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.519
provocations at every stage of the

273
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.920
process kept her metacognitively

274
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:18.800
engaged, always looking for critiques,

275
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.560
alternatives, and lateral moves. We have

276
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.760
been studying the effects of tools like

277
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.920
this and the results are promising.

278
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.600
You can demonstraably reintroduce

279
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.519
critical thinking into AI assisted

280
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.839
workflows. You can reverse the loss of

281
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.920
creativity and enhance it instead. You

282
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:35.680
can build powerful tools for memory that

283
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.440
enable knowledge workers to read and

284
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.839
write at speed with greater

285
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.760
intentionality and remember it too. It

286
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.519
turns out with the right principles of

287
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.680
design, you can build tools that are the

288
00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.600
best of both worlds. applying the

289
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:50.000
awesome speed and flexibility of this

290
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.080
technology to protect and enhance human

291
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.560
thought. These are simple general

292
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.760
principles like ensuring that the tool

293
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.440
preserves material material engagement,

294
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.920
offers productive resistance and

295
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.680
scaffolds metacognition.

296
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.040
And while we've been primarily studying

297
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.640
professional knowledge workers, we

298
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.959
believe that these principles can extend

299
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.560
to all aspects of AI use, including when

300
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:12.959
we use it in our daily lives, our

301
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.200
hobbies, and even in education. I

302
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:18.000
repeat, efficiency is not the aim of

303
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.640
tools for thought. Better thinking is,

304
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.839
but sometimes you can have both. I used

305
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.240
to think there was no such thing as a

306
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:26.240
free lunch in human thinking. This is so

307
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.680
much better than a free lunch. This is a

308
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.279
lunch that pays you to eat it.

309
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.600
I want to close with some thoughts on

310
00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:35.839
the values that we have in developing AI

311
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.600
software. What if AI gets to the point

312
00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:39.600
where it can do a better job of thinking

313
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.920
than humans? Why should we care so much

314
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.040
about protecting and augmenting human

315
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.399
thought? There's two reasons. First,

316
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.320
there may always be ways of thinking

317
00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:50.560
that remain unique human strengths of

318
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.399
which we may not even be aware. Second,

319
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560
perhaps more importantly, we take the

320
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:56.720
position that the ability to think well

321
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.120
is essential for human agency and

322
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.040
empowerment and flourishing. This echoes

323
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.880
an ancient question. People once asked,

324
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.200
you know, if writing, if books, if the

325
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.360
internet can remember for us, does it

326
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.120
matter that we cannot? People once asked

327
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.839
if maps can navigate for us, does it

328
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.920
matter that we cannot? Now we ask, if

329
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:15.519
machines can think for us, does it

330
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.760
matter that we cannot? If machines can

331
00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:19.839
speak for us, grieve for us, pray for

332
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.440
us, love for us, does it matter that we

333
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:23.360
cannot? To me, the answer is pretty

334
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.200
obvious. When I began studying human AI

335
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.800
interaction 13 years ago, it was

336
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.040
inconceivable to me that we would be

337
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.600
asking these questions in my lifetime.

338
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.040
But we are, and we must. I leave you

339
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.760
with this thought. What would you rather

340
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.238
have? A tool that thinks for you or a

341
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.258
tool that makes you think.

342
00:11:38.238 --> 00:11:40.258
>> [applause]
